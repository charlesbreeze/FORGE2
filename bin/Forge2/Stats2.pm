=head1 SYNOPSIS
Provide various stats for Forge2 to do its stuff
=head1 EXPORT
mean

std
log10
binomial
factorial
fdr
=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS
=head2 mean
Calculates the biased mean of an array
pass it a float array and it will return the mean
reused from Ben Brown
=cut


sub mean {
    my $sum = 0;
    foreach (@_){
        $sum+= $_;
    }
    return $sum/($#_+1);
}

=head2 variance
Calculates the biased variance of an array
Pass it a float array and it will return the variance
Reused from Ben Brown
=cut

sub variance {
    my $ev = mean(@_);
    my $sum = 0;
    foreach (@_) { $sum += ($_ - $ev)**2 };

    return $sum/($#_+1);
}

=head2 std
Calulates the standard deviation of an array: this is just the sqrt of the var
=cut

sub std { sqrt(variance(@_)) }

=head2 log10
log 10 since perl doesn't have
=cut

sub log10 {
    my $n = shift;
    return log($n)/log(10);
}

=head2 zscore
Calculates the z-score for a given result and an array of values
=cut

sub zscore {
    my ($teststat, $values) = @_;
    my $zscore;

    my $mean = mean(@$values);
    my $sd = std(@$values);
    if ($sd == 0) {
        $zscore = "NA";
    } else {
        $zscore = sprintf("%.3f", ($teststat-$mean)/$sd);
    }

    return $zscore;
}

=head2 binomial
Exact solution of binomial probability for k picks out of n, for n or greater need to sum for each k up to n
=cut

sub binomial {

    my ($k, $n, $p) = @_;

    my $prob = exp($k*log($p) + ($n-$k)*log(1 - $p) + log_factorial($n) - log_factorial($k) - log_factorial($n - $k));

    return $prob;
}

=head2 log_factorial
Calculate log(N!). Required for binomial.
Uses a cache to speed up the calculation.
=cut

my %_log_factorial_cache;

sub log_factorial{
    my ($n) = shift;
    return 0 if($n <=1 ); # log(1) = 0
    return $_log_factorial_cache{$n} if (exists($_log_factorial_cache{$n}));
    my $result = 0; # log(1) = 0;
    for (my $i = $n; $i > 1; $i--) {
        $result += log($i);
    }
    $_log_factorial_cache{$n} = $result;
    return $_log_factorial_cache{$n};
}

=head2 fdr
Empirical false discovery rate = FP/TP+FP.
Need to modify this now have switched to binomial p values.
=cut


sub fdr{
    my ($tp, $snps, $cells) = @_;
    if ($tp == 0){
        return "NA";
    }
    else{
        my $fpr = 0.0085 * exp(-0.04201 * $snps) + 0.00187; # from simulations of random data (Forge, not Forge2->) 0.0085*exp(-0.04201. SNPs) + 0.00187
        my $fdr = ($cells * $fpr) / $tp;
        return $fdr;
    }
}
